# OnlineExamSystem
Full Stack Online Exam taking System.

This system allows for two entities, a professor and a student. A professor can log in, create questions for a question bank, choose questions from the bank to add to the exam, and publish the exam. At this point, a student can log in and take the exam, after which the autograder grades it, and stores the graded information along with the questions and student answers in the database. The professor can then log in, change grades as necessary, and publish them for the student to view.

Code is no longer fully functional due to parts of the database being taken down by administrators running the PHPMyAdmin SQL Database system at NJIT.
